# ProjectSite

## TowFinders 
TowFinders is a site to help users find and compare towing and roadside assistance services.
This app would be used mainly by companies that offer roadside assistance to their customers. This site would allow reps to search for towing companies based on certain criteria and allow their customers to search and contact roadside services as well.

This idea comes from my experience working as a customer service representative at a company that offers roadside assistance. At present, there is a need to simplify the process of helping customers get that assistance.

At present, when a customer calls in for roadside services, reps have to transfer the call to a different department in another 
state. With this site, reps will be able to access a roadside assistance in the customer's zipcode and connect them directly to 
a towing service. 

### Features
Optional login or use as guest capability.
Search by zipcode, name, type of service needed.
Allow customers to enter pick-up and destination info
Compare button to compare prices and services offered
Chat feature to ask questions.
Contact feature to call (mobile).

### Technologies
C#
EF Core
MVC

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to build a database from scratch, as well as authentication for login. I plan to make this app mobile-friendly, so I will probably look into Kik framework.
